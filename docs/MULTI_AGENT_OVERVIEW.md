## 🎯 Introduction

AI-Scientist-v2 represents a revolutionary approach to autonomous scientific research through a sophisticated multi-agent system. Instead of relying on a single AI model, we orchestrate specialized agents that work together to achieve complex research objectives while maintaining ethical standards and optimizing performance.

## 🔄 Coordination Modes

### Sequential Mode
Agents work in a predetermined sequence, with each agent building upon the previous agent's work.

**Best For**:
- Linear research processes
- Step-by-step methodology
- Quality-critical workflows

**Example**: Ideation → Experimental Design → Data Analysis → Paper Writing

### Parallel Mode
Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of the same research problem.

**Best For**:
- Time-sensitive research
- Multi-faceted problems
- Resource optimization

**Example**: Simultaneous literature review, experimental design, and data preparation

### Consensus Mode
Multiple agents work independently on the same problem and build consensus through voting or agreement mechanisms.

**Best For**:
- High-stakes decisions
- Quality-critical outcomes
- Risk mitigation

**Example**: Multiple agents analyzing the same dataset to ensure accuracy

### Competitive Mode
Multiple agents compete to find the best solution, with the highest-performing agent selected.

**Best For**:
- Optimization problems
- Innovation discovery
- Performance maximization

**Example**: Multiple agents developing different algorithms, best one selected
